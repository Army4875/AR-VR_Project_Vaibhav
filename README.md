# AR-VR_Project_Vaibhav
ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Vaibhav, a passionate tech enthusiast and a B.Tech CSE graduate. I have a strong foundation in Java development and a keen interest in AR/VR technologies. I also explore the exciting world of cybersecurity inÂ myÂ spareÂ time.
In this repository I have uploaded my two main projects namely, AR Depth Effect and VR City Tour.

In AR Depth Effect project I have developed something new and unique which seems very good. You will get to know about Depth Effect in AR.

In VR project I have developed a virtual city where you can explore two places namely, Art Gallery and Theatre room. The purpose of this project is to create an awareness about VR and it's upcoming future which is going to change our entire way of viewing anything.
